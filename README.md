# KRISHICULTURE

## Overview

KRISHICULTURE is a platform developed to address the challenges faced by farmers in India, especially in the context of growing global food scarcity and the need for sustainable agricultural solutions. Inspired by AgroStar, a platform focused on agricultural inputs, KRISHICULTURE extends its capabilities to the output and post-harvest aspects of farming. This project empowers farmers with real-time market data, weather insights, and resources, aiming to promote sustainable practices and food security for future generations.

In recent years, unpredictable weather patterns, hoarding activities, and fluctuating transport costs have contributed to price instability for essential vegetables, causing significant challenges for both farmers and consumers. KRISHICULTURE was created to help farmers navigate these issues with tools for better decision-making and access to critical information.
